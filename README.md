<h1 align="center">Algoritms in C</h1>

<h3 align="center">This repository showcases various algorithms for famous algorithms</h3>

<br/>

> [!Note]
> The Algorithms are divided by directories following a very simple structure, as outlined below: 

```

  Algorithms in C
    |
    ├── Algorithm A
    │   ├── algorithm-a.c
    │   ├── library.h  
    │   ├── performance-analysis
    │   │   ├── data.txt
    │   │   └── graphic.png
    │   └── README.md  
    | 
    ├── Algorithm B
    |   ├── algorithm-b.c
    |   ├── library.h  
    │   └── README.md  
    .
    .
    .
    └── README.md (this file)

```
<br/>
<b>Not every program will have performance analysis, due to its simplicity or the program not being scalable (one example of scalable program is N-Queen Solution, since N ∈ [5, ∞[)</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<p> As evident from the structure, each algorithm directory will include a dedicated README file. This README will comprehensively outline any performance analysis conducted, provide detailed explanations of the code, and offer instructions on how to execute it effectively</p>
